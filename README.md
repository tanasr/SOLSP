# Solution and Optimisation of large-scale problems

## Assignment 1 - Minimise the Himmelblau and Rosenbrock functions 

### Gradient Descent
Implement the gradient descent to minimise the Himmelblau and Rosenbrock functions. Plot the energy landscape and the path followed by the optimiser, with a black dot as the starting point. Further, generalise the algorithm using Matlabs symbolic toolbox, using symbolic computation to compute gradients of a third function. The respective contour plots are pictured below:

### Newton Method
Implement the Newton method to minimise the Himmelblau and Rosenbrock functions. Plot the energy landscape and the path followed by the optimiser, with a black dot as the starting point. Further, generalise the algorithm using Matlabs symbolic toolbox, using symbolic computation to compute gradients of a third function. The respective contour plots are pictured below:

## Assignment 2 - Finite-Difference, Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel solvers, Two-level multi-grid method

### 1D Laplace equation
Discretise the Laplace Equation by using the finite difference stencil, so that we express the discrete problem as a linear system of equations: Lh*u = f (where Lh is the discrete Laplacian operator). 

- Consider a discretisation of N equidistant intervals, where h = N1 and the first and last elements of u are the boundary conditions: u1 = uN+1 = 0 and u2 ... uN are the unknowns.
- Plot the first and last eigenvectors of Lh and its inverse and discuss  the behaviour for different mesh sizes h. How does the spectrum behave as h goes to 0?

- Consider the Gershgorin circle theorem. Write a Matlab script that plots the Gershgorin circles and shows that all eigenvalues lie inside one of these circles.
![Gershgorin](Assignment2/src/laplace_1d/plots/Gershgorin_discs.png)
The Gershgorin discs allow us to estimate where the eigenvalues of the matrix Lh might be, i.e., it gives us a range for the eigenvalues. Each eigenvalue is plotted in a different colour. For N = 10 we have 10 discs in total. Since the matrix is symmetric, i.e., the sum of the off-diagonal entries is same for every row (except first and last), the radii are also the same. Therefore we get two overlapping circles with radius 100, and 8 overlapping circles with radius 200.






### Iterative linear solvers
Implement the Jacobi and the Gauss-Seidel methods for solving a linear system of equations (element-wise, without using the vectorial operator from Matlab). 

- Test the Jacobi and the Gauss-Seidel methods with the problem from Exercise 1 for a finite number of steps and different sizes of Lh by using a null vector as initial guess (u0 = 0).
- Plot the norm of the residuals as a function of the steps.
- In a separate chart plot the evolution of the error ek = u âˆ’ uk as a function of x. Which smoother converges faster?


### Two-level multi-grid method
Implement a two-level mutli-grid solver, where:
- In the fine level you use the Jacobi and/or the Gauss-Seidel smoother
- In the coarse level you use a direct solver, e.g. the backslash operator from Matlab.
Make your implementation as general as possible, so you are able to change smoother on the fly.
- Test the two-level multi-grid method with the model problem from Exercise 1 by using both the Jacobi and the Gauss-
Seidel methods as a smoother. Plot the norm of the residuals and errors as a function of the steps in separate charts.
