# Solution and Optimisation of large-scale problems

## Assignment 1 - Minimise the Himmelblau and Rosenbrock functions 

### Gradient Descent
Implement the gradient descent to minimise the Himmelblau and Rosenbrock functions. Plot the energy landscape and the path followed by the optimiser, with a black dot as the starting point. Further, generalise the algorithm using Matlabs symbolic toolbox, using symbolic computation to compute gradients of a third function. The respective contour plots are pictured below:

### Newton Method
Implement the Newton method to minimise the Himmelblau and Rosenbrock functions. Plot the energy landscape and the path followed by the optimiser, with a black dot as the starting point. Further, generalise the algorithm using Matlabs symbolic toolbox, using symbolic computation to compute gradients of a third function. The respective contour plots are pictured below:
